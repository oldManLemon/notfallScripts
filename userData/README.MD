# Change Shared User Paths(Drive Maps GPO Changer)

## Introduction

In order to control our shared folders to various stations we have a range of GPO policies that map drive paths and letters to local users based on Group memberships or individual user.

This script was designed as the panic script for when these servers may fall over. This script will run through all the GPO's and where appropriate take action to change the drive path to central server. Currently there is a debate whether we switch back after directing all the traffic to the central server.

  

## Usage

Run the script with a station flag to indicate which station to target. 

1. Open Powershell and `cd` to the script location.

2. Run the script `.\changeGPO.ps1 -Station FRA`

3. CAUTION, CURRENTLY THERE IS NO REVERSE!!!!!

4. ACHTUNG, KEINE RÜCKGÄNGIG MÖGLICH!

### Flags
`-Station` Station flags

 - `MUC` {München}
 - `HAM` {Hambur}
 - `HQ`   {Head Quaters}
 - `BRE` {Bremen}
 - `CGN` {Köln}
 - `BER` {Berlin}
 - `HAJ` {Hannover}
 - `FRA` {Frankfurt}
 - `ALL` {Alle Stationen Läuft}

  

## Features

There are some cleanup features included. Christian requested that all new paths should include `HAJ_OrnderName` or `DUS_OrnderName` for example. Some folders seem to already be following this convention or have attempted to follow this convention by placing the name at the end `OrdnerName_DUS` for example.

The script will clean the folders names and standardise them to be the same.

### Name Scrubber

Assume the 3 variables on the folder names below and that they are all from FRA's server

  

FRA_tiger

tiger_FRA

tiger

The script will output:

  

FRA_tiger

FRA_tiger

FRA_tiger

  

## Output File

The current actions that will be taken by the script are available to be seen from the attached the TXT file.
